# Placement-and-Routing

### This repository comprises of algorithms for proper Placement of VLSI circuits using analytical placement using the Quadratic Wavelength model and Recursive partitioning.
### Once the netlist is generated upon placement, we also use the Maze Routing algorithm for Routing the given Netlist files on a given grid, whose placement is already determined.

### These algorithms have been implemented on example circuits obtained from the asic placement and routing course by University of Illinois.
